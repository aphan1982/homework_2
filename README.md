# homework_2

//OVERVIEW//
    This contains the homework assignment 2:Responsive Portfolio. The reset of CSS styles is resolved via Bootstrap's framework presets.

//PAGE STRUCTURE//
    • index.html--Landing page, containing navigation and image links to other portions of the website. It appears as an "About Me" section. Subordinate to index.html are:
    • portfolio.html--Containing placeholder cards to feature various coding projects/links.
    • media.html--Containing external links to audio, visual, and textual resources.
    • contact.html--Containing a form for visitors to submit a brief message.

//CSS DEFAULTS//
    "Orange" is defined as RGB(237, 156, 75) throughout.
    "Red" is defined as RGB(218, 57, 50) throughout.

//SPECIFIC ITEMS TO BE WORKED ON/RESOLVED LATER//
    • The card <div> tags on portfolio.html shold be clickable <a> links. This will require some JavaScript/CSS massaging outside the realm of the Bootstrap framework.
    • media.html needs better links put in place. This would be a prime place to drop in video or audio players.
